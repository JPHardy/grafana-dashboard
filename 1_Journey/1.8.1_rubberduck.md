prompt: I am having a hard time deploying a grafana dashboard in github codepsaces over a minikube. The grafana gets deployed but not the dashboards

output:
Deploying Grafana dashboards in GitHub Codespaces over Minikube can present challenges, especially if the dashboards aren't being deployed properly. Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### 1. **Verify Dashboard Configuration**
   - Ensure your dashboards are defined correctly as JSON files.
   - Place them in the correct directory for provisioning. By default, Grafana looks for dashboards in `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards` or a custom path you specify in the `provisioning` configuration.

prompt: I am using bitnami templates 
output:
If you're using Bitnami templates to deploy Grafana, the setup will differ slightly since Bitnami charts come with pre-configured templates and options for customization. Here's how you can ensure your Grafana dashboards are deployed correctly:

---

### 1. **Enable Dashboard Provisioning in Bitnami Chart**
   - Bitnami Helm charts for Grafana allow you to provision dashboards through ConfigMaps or by mounting them as files.
   - First, verify the **values.yaml** file for your Bitnami chart deployment and ensure the following settings are enabled:

     ```yaml
     dashboardsConfigMaps:
       enabled: true

     dashboards:
       example-dashboard:
         json: |
           {
             "uid": "example",
             "title": "Example Dashboard",
             ...
           }
     ```
