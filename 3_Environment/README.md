## The Roadmap and Use Cases

A roadmap with learning modules and real-world use cases to apply new skills. This section provides a structured approach to mastering the environment setup and usage.

### Environment Base

The environment setup includes the following components:

- **Codespaces**: For a cloud-based development environment.
- **Minikube**: To run Kubernetes locally.
- **Grafana**: For monitoring and observability.

### References and Rationale

- **Codespaces**: Provides a consistent development environment, reducing setup time and ensuring compatibility.
- **Minikube**: Allows for local Kubernetes development and testing, which is essential for understanding container orchestration.
- **Grafana**: Enables monitoring of applications and infrastructure, crucial for maintaining system health and performance.

This roadmap ensures that you have a solid foundation in these tools, preparing you for real-world applications and advanced learning modules.
