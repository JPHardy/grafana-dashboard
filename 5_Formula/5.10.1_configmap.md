Sure! Here's a Mermaid chart that shows the relationship between ConfigMap and Deployment objects in Kubernetes:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Kubernetes
        ConfigMap["ConfigMap"]
        Deployment["Deployment"]
        Pod["Pod"]
    end

    Deployment -->|uses| ConfigMap
    Deployment -->|creates| Pod
    ConfigMap -->|provides| Pod
```

In this diagram:
- The **Deployment** uses the **ConfigMap** to configure the Pods it creates.
- The **ConfigMap** provides configuration data to the Pods.

You can visualize this diagram using the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/edit/). If you need further customization or have more specific requirements, feel free to let me know!
