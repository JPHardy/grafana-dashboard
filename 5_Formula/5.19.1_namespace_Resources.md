# Grafana Monitoring Namespace Resources

Here is a list of all resources inside the `-n grafana-monitoring` namespace:

## Scripts ðŸš€
It looks like you're trying to run a `kubectl` command to get resources in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace across all namespaces. The command you provided seems mostly correct, but it has a small issue. The `-A` flag is used to list resources across all namespaces, which conflicts with specifying a single namespace using `-n`.

If you want to list resources specifically in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace, you should use:

```sh
kubectl get all -n grafana-monitoring
```

If you want to list resources across all namespaces, you can use:

```sh
kubectl get all -A
```

Let me know if you need any more help with `kubectl` commands!
