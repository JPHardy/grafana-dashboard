In a Bitnami Helm chart (e.g., for Grafana or other applications), the `GF_LOG_LEVEL=debug` setting is used to set the logging level of the application to `debug`. This provides detailed logs that are useful for troubleshooting and debugging issues.

To set this configuration in the `values.yaml` file for a Bitnami Helm chart, you can typically use the `envVars` or a similar section, depending on the application's configuration. Here's how you can set it:

### Example for a `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
grafana:
  envVars:
    - name: GF_LOG_LEVEL
      value: debug
```

### Steps to Apply the Configuration:
1. **Edit the `values.yaml` File**: Add the `envVars` section (or the relevant section for your chart) with the `GF_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable set to `debug`.
   
2. **Install or Upgrade the Helm Chart**:
   - If you are installing the chart for the first time:
     ```bash
     helm install my-release bitnami/grafana -f values.yaml
     ```
   - If you are upgrading an existing release:
     ```bash
     helm upgrade my-release bitnami/grafana -f values.yaml
     ```

3. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Check the environment variables in the running Grafana pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <grafana-pod-name> -- printenv | grep GF_LOG_LEVEL
     ```
   - Review the Grafana logs to confirm the log level is set to `debug`:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <grafana-pod-name>
     ```

### Notes:
- Replace `<grafana-pod-name>` with the actual pod name of the Grafana instance.
- Ensure that the Helm chart version and application version support the `GF_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

This setting enables detailed logs but may increase the volume of logs, so it's best used in development or troubleshooting scenarios rather than production environments.
