# Dashboard Provisioning Process in Grafana by Code

Grafana allows you to provision dashboards using code. This can be done by creating JSON files that define the dashboards and placing them in a specific directory. Here is a step-by-step guide to provisioning dashboards in Grafana by code:

## Step 1: Create the Dashboard JSON File

Create a JSON file that defines your dashboard. Here is an example of a simple dashboard JSON:

```json
{
    "dashboard": {
        "id": null,
        "uid": "example-dashboard",
        "title": "Example Dashboard",
        "tags": ["templated"],
        "timezone": "browser",
        "schemaVersion": 16,
        "version": 0,
        "panels": [
            {
                "type": "graph",
                "title": "Example Graph",
                "gridPos": {
                    "x": 0,
                    "y": 0,
                    "w": 24,
                    "h": 9
                },
                "targets": [
                    {
                        "expr": "rate(http_requests_total[5m])",
                        "interval": "",
                        "legendFormat": "{{method}} {{status}}",
                        "refId": "A"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "overwrite": true
}
```

Save this file as `example-dashboard.json`.

## Step 2: Configure Grafana to Provision Dashboards

Create a provisioning configuration file in the Grafana provisioning directory. By default, this directory is located at `/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`. Create a new YAML file, for example, `dashboard.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
    - name: 'default'
        orgId: 1
        folder: ''
        type: file
        disableDeletion: false
        updateIntervalSeconds: 10
        options:
            path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
```

## Step 3: Place the Dashboard JSON File in the Provisioning Directory

Move your `example-dashboard.json` file to the directory specified in the `path` option of the provisioning configuration file. In this example, the directory is `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards`.

## Step 4: Restart Grafana

Restart the Grafana service to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

## Conclusion

Your dashboard should now be provisioned and available in Grafana. You can verify this by logging into Grafana and navigating to the dashboards section.
