The error messages you're encountering suggest that Helm believes the release name `grafana` is already in use, but when attempting to uninstall it, the release cannot be found. This often happens due to stale Helm metadata or incorrect namespaces.

Here is a step-by-step method to troubleshoot and write the proper uninstall process:

### Steps to Uninstall a Helm Release

1. **Check the Installed Releases**  
   First, confirm if the release `grafana` exists and which namespace it's in. Run:
   ```bash
   helm list --all-namespaces
   ```
   This will show all releases across all namespaces. Look for a release named `grafana`.

2. **Uninstall the Release in the Correct Namespace**  
   If you find `grafana` in a specific namespace (e.g., `grafana-monitoring`), uninstall it:
   ```bash
   helm uninstall grafana --namespace grafana-monitoring
   ```

3. **Manually Clean Up Stale Resources**  
   If the release still cannot be uninstalled, you may need to clean up Kubernetes resources manually:
   - Delete any Helm-related ConfigMaps or Secrets:
     ```bash
     kubectl -n grafana-monitoring get configmaps,secrets | grep grafana
     kubectl -n grafana-monitoring delete configmap <name>
     kubectl -n grafana-monitoring delete secret <name>
     ```
   - Ensure no lingering Pods, Services, or other resources exist:
     ```bash
     kubectl -n grafana-monitoring get all | grep grafana
     kubectl -n grafana-monitoring delete <resource-type> <name>
     ```

4. **Reinstall Grafana**
   Once the stale resources are cleaned up, attempt the installation again:
   ```bash
   helm install grafana bitnami/grafana --namespace grafana-monitoring -f grafana-dashboard-deployment.yaml
   ```

### Possible Causes for the Issue
- **Namespace Mismatch**: The release may have been installed in a different namespace.
- **Corrupted Metadata**: Helm's metadata might be out of sync with the actual cluster state.
- **Previous Failed Installation**: A failed installation can leave behind partial resources that need cleanup.

By following these steps, you should be able to uninstall and reinstall the Grafana Helm release cleanly.
