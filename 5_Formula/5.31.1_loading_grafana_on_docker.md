To load your custom dashboard to Grafana using the Bitnami Grafana container, you can follow these steps:

---

### **1. Place Your Dashboard JSON File**
Prepare your custom dashboard in JSON format and copy it to a directory accessible by the Bitnami Grafana container.

- Example: Save your dashboard file as `my-dashboard.json`.

---

### **2. Provision the Dashboard**
Grafana uses provisioning to automatically load dashboards. You can create a provisioning YAML file to define the dashboards you want to load.

#### **Create a Provisioning File**
Create a new file called `dashboards.yaml` in the provisioning directory. By default, in the Bitnami Grafana container, the provisioning directory is `/opt/bitnami/grafana/conf/provisioning/dashboards`.

Example content of `dashboards.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: 1
providers:
  - name: 'custom'
    folder: 'Custom Dashboards'
    type: 'file'
    options:
      path: '/opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards'
```

#### **Explanation**:
- `name`: The name of the provider (can be anything).
- `folder`: The folder in Grafana where the dashboards will appear.
- `path`: The path inside the container where your JSON files are stored.

---

### **3. Add Your Dashboard Files**
Mount the directory containing your dashboard JSON file into the container.

If you're using Docker, you can mount the directory by adding the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker run -d --name grafana \
  -v /path/to/dashboards:/opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards \
  -v /path/to/dashboards.yaml:/opt/bitnami/grafana/conf/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yaml \
  bitnami/grafana
```

Replace:
- `/path/to/dashboards` with the directory where your `my-dashboard.json` is located.
- `/path/to/dashboards.yaml` with the path to the `dashboards.yaml` file.

---

### **4. Restart Grafana**
If Grafana is already running, restart the container to apply the changes:

```bash
docker restart grafana
```

---

### **5. Verify the Dashboard**
1. Log in to Grafana using your admin credentials.
2. Navigate to the folder specified in the `dashboards.yaml` file (`Custom Dashboards` in this example).
3. Your custom dashboard should appear there.

---

### **6. (Optional) Environment Variables**
You can also configure environment variables in the Bitnami Grafana container to specify paths or options dynamically. For example:
```bash
-e GF_PATHS_PROVISIONING=/opt/bitnami/grafana/conf/provisioning
```

---

This approach ensures that your custom dashboards are automatically loaded into Grafana whenever the container starts or restarts. Let me know if you need further assistance!
