## 🛠️ Provision Grafana Dashboards

Grafana allows you to manage dashboards by adding YAML configuration files in the `provisioning/dashboards` directory. Each configuration file can contain a list of dashboard providers that load dashboards into Grafana from the local filesystem.

### 📁 Example Dashboard Provider Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
    - name: 'unique-provider-name'
        orgId: 1
        folder: ''
        folderUid: ''
        type: file
        disableDeletion: false
        updateIntervalSeconds: 10
        allowUiUpdates: false
        options:
            path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
            foldersFromFilesStructure: true
```

When Grafana starts, it updates and inserts all dashboards available in the configured path. Grafana polls that path every `updateIntervalSeconds`, looks for updated JSON files, and updates and inserts those into the database.

### 📝 Making Changes to a Provisioned Dashboard

- **Editable Dashboards**: If `allowUiUpdates` is set to `true`, changes made in the Grafana UI can be saved to the database.
- **Non-Editable Dashboards**: If `allowUiUpdates` is `false`, changes cannot be saved from the UI.

### 📂 Provision Folders Structure from Filesystem

To replicate a folder structure from the filesystem to Grafana, use the `foldersFromFilesStructure` option.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
    - name: dashboards
        type: file
        updateIntervalSeconds: 30
        options:
            path: /etc/dashboards
            foldersFromFilesStructure: true
```

This configuration will create folders in Grafana based on the filesystem structure.

### 🔄 Reusable Dashboard URLs

If the dashboard JSON file contains a UID, Grafana forces insert/update on that UID, allowing you to migrate dashboards between instances without breaking URLs.

### ⚠️ Notes

- **Provisioned Dashboards**: Changes made in the UI are overwritten by the source file upon update.
- **Disable Deletion**: Use `disableDeletion: true` to prevent Grafana from deleting dashboards if the source file is removed.
