To delete all pods in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace, you can use the following `kubectl` command:

```sh
kubectl delete pods --all -n grafana-monitoring
```

This command will delete all pods in the specified namespace. Be cautious when running this command, as it will terminate all running pods in that namespace.
