Sure, I can help you create a basic `grafana.ini` configuration file with datasources. Here's an example:

```ini
[server]
http_port = 3000

[database]
type = sqlite3
path = grafana.db

[security]
admin_user = admin
admin_password = admin

[auth.anonymous]
enabled = true

[datasources]
[[datasources]]
name = MyDataSource
type = prometheus
url = http://localhost:9090
access = proxy
basicAuth = false
```

This configuration sets up Grafana to run on port 3000, uses an SQLite database, and includes a Prometheus datasource. You can customize the `name`, `type`, `url`, and other parameters based on your specific datasource requirements.

If you need more detailed customization or additional datasources, feel free to let me know!
