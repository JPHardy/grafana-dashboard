Here's a comprehensive comparison of major AI language models including code-focused capabilities:

| Model | Code Capabilities | Context Window | Key Strengths | Best Used For |
|-------|------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Advanced code generation, debugging, multiple languages, strong documentation | 200K | Superior reasoning, code understanding, clear explanations | Complex software architecture, technical documentation, system design |
| Claude 3 Opus | Extensive code generation, nuanced debugging, in-depth code review | 200K | Advanced technical writing, detailed code analysis | Long-form technical content, large codebase analysis |
| GPT-4 | Good code generation, basic debugging | 8K/32K | Broad knowledge, reliable outputs | General coding tasks, simple debugging |
| GPT-4 Turbo | Enhanced code capabilities, newer APIs/frameworks | 128K | Up-to-date technical knowledge | Modern development tasks, API integration |
| GitHub Copilot | Specialized code completion, real-time suggestions | File-based | Direct IDE integration, context-aware | Active development, code completion |
| Amazon CodeWhisperer | AWS-focused code generation | File-based | AWS service integration | AWS development, cloud architecture |
| Anthropic Claude 2 | Strong code analysis, multiple language support | 100K | Technical accuracy, detailed explanations | Code review, technical documentation |

Some notable features specific to code tasks:

1. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Claude models: Excellent at generating comprehensive documentation
   - GPT-4: Good but less detailed
   - Copilot: Limited to inline comments

2. **Language Support**:
   - Claude models: Excellent across many languages including modern frameworks
   - GPT-4: Strong in popular languages
   - Specialized tools: Often better in their specific domains (e.g., CodeWhisperer for AWS)

3. **Testing Support**:
   - Claude models: Can generate comprehensive test suites
   - GPT-4: Basic test generation
   - Copilot: Good at suggesting unit tests

Note: My knowledge about specific capabilities might not be fully up to date, so I recommend checking the official documentation for the most current information.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these models' code capabilities?
