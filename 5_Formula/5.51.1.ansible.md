Data sources
You can manage data sources in Grafana by adding YAML configuration files in the provisioning/datasources directory. Each configuration file can contain a list of datasources to add or update during startup. If the data source already exists, Grafana reconfigures it to match the provisioned configuration file.

The configuration file can also list data sources to automatically delete, called deleteDatasources. Grafana deletes the data sources listed in deleteDatasources before adding or updating those in the datasources list.

You can configure Grafana to automatically delete provisioned data sources when theyâ€™re removed from the provisioning file. To do so, add prune: true to the root of your provisioning file. With this configuration, Grafana also removes the provisioned data sources if you remove the provisioning file entirely.

Note

The prune parameter is available in Grafana v11.1 and higher.
