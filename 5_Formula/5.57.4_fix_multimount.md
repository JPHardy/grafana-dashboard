To reference two different files as sources in a Kubernetes `configMap`, you can define multiple `configMap` entries under the `volumes` section. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume1
      mountPath: /etc/config1
    - name: config-volume2
      mountPath: /etc/config2
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume1
    configMap:
      name: grafana-datasources1
  - name: config-volume2
    configMap:
      name: grafana-datasources2
```

In this example, two `configMap` entries are defined under the `volumes` section, each with a unique name. The `volumeMounts` section in the container specifies the mount paths for each `configMap`.

Does this help with your setup?
