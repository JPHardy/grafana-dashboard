# Docker Hello World

This guide will help you run a simple "Hello World" application using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Steps

1. **Create a Dockerfile**

    Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.8-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Run the command to start the application
    CMD ["python", "-c", "print('Hello, World!')"]
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image**

    Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`, and run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker build -t hello-world .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container**

    After the image is built, run the container using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    You should see the output:

    ```
    Hello, World!
    ```

Congratulations! You've successfully run a "Hello World" application using Docker.

## Running the Docker Container without a Dockerfile

If you want to run the "Hello World" application without creating a Dockerfile, you can use the following command directly:

```sh
docker run python:3.8-slim python -c "print('Hello, World!')"
```

This command pulls the `python:3.8-slim` image from Docker Hub (if not already available locally) and runs the Python command to print "Hello, World!".

## Running a Basic Docker Container

If you want to run a basic "Hello World" application without creating a Dockerfile, you can use the following command directly:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

This command pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub (if not already available locally) and runs it, displaying a "Hello from Docker!" message.
