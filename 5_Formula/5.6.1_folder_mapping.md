To add a folder name into the ConfigMap, you can structure your ConfigMap to include multiple files, each representing a dashboard. Here's an example of how you can modify your ConfigMap to include a folder structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-dashboard-config
  labels:
    grafana_dashboard: "1"
data:
  dashboards/sample-dashboard.json: |
    {
      "dashboard": {
        "id": null,
        "uid": null,
        "title": "Sample Dashboard",
        "tags": [],
        "timezone": "browser",
        "schemaVersion": 16,
        "version": 0,
        "refresh": "5s",
        "panels": [
          {
            "type": "graph",
            "title": "Sample Graph",
            "gridPos": {
              "x": 0,
              "y": 0,
              "w": 24,
              "h": 9
            },
            "id": 1,
            "datasource": null,
            "targets": [
              {
                "target": "sample.metric",
                "refId": "A"
              }
            ],
            "lines": true,
            "linewidth": 1,
            "nullPointMode": "null"
          }
        ]
      },
      "overwrite": false
    }
```

In this example, the dashboard JSON is stored under the `dashboards` folder within the ConfigMap. You can add more dashboards by creating additional entries under the `data` section, each with a unique key representing the file path.

Make sure your deployment YAML mounts the ConfigMap correctly:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: grafana-dashboard-config
    mountPath: /opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards
    readOnly: true
volumes:
  - name: grafana-dashboard-config
    configMap:
      name: grafana-dashboard-config
      items:
        - key: dashboards/sample-dashboard.json
          path: sample-dashboard.json
```

This setup ensures that the ConfigMap is mounted to the correct directory in your Grafana pod.
