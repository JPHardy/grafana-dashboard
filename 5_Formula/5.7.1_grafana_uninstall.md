It looks like Helm is unable to find the `grafana` release to uninstall. This could be because the release name is incorrect or the release was never installed. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **List Helm Releases**: Check the list of Helm releases in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace to ensure the release name is correct. Use the following command:
   ```sh
   helm list -n grafana-monitoring

   @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-dashboard/6_Symbols/2_Grafana (main) $ helm list -n grafana-monitoring
NAME    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED STATUS  CHART   APP VERSION
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-dashboard/6_Symbols/2_Grafana (main) $ 

   ```

2. **Verify Namespace**: Ensure that you are using the correct namespace. If the release was installed in a different namespace, you need to specify that namespace.

3. **Check Helm History**: If the release was previously installed and then deleted, you can check the Helm history to see if there are any remnants of the release:
   ```sh
   helm history grafana -n grafana-monitoring
   ```

   @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-dashboard/6_Symbols/2_Grafana (main) $  helm history grafana -n grafana-monitoring
Error: release: not found

4. **Clean Up Manually**: If the release is not found but you still have resources deployed, you might need to clean them up manually. You can delete the resources using `kubectl` commands.

Here's an example of how you might list the Helm releases:

```sh
helm list -n grafana-monitoring
```
