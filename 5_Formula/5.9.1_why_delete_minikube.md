The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties:

1. **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2. **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guaranteeing that it contains the most recent write.
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes[1](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/cap-theorem.html).

In the context of Kubernetes, which uses etcd as its key-value store, the CAP theorem is particularly relevant. Etcd implements the Raft consensus algorithm, which prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance (CP) over availability. This means that during network partitions, etcd will ensure data consistency but may sacrifice availability[2](https://dev.to/jaiminbariya/understanding-quorum-based-approaches-in-distributed-systems-jaimin-bariya-5h1b).

**Quorum** in distributed systems refers to the minimum number of nodes that must agree to complete an operation. This concept is crucial for maintaining consistency and fault tolerance. For example, in a write quorum, a majority of nodes must confirm a write operation before it is considered successful[2](https://dev.to/jaiminbariya/understanding-quorum-based-approaches-in-distributed-systems-jaimin-bariya-5h1b).
