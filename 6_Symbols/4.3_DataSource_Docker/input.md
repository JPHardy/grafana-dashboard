To install Grafana using Docker and set up data sources, you can follow these steps:

Install Grafana using Docker:
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana grafana/grafana-enterprise
This command runs the latest stable version of Grafana Enterprise, mapping port 3000 to allow access via your browser Run Grafana Docker image.

Access Grafana: Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000. Log in using the default credentials:

Username: admin
Password: admin
Add data sources: Once logged in, you can add data sources through the Grafana UI:

Click on "Connections" in the left-side menu
Search for the data source you want to add
Click on the data source and then "Add new data source"
Configure the data source with the required settings (URL, authentication, etc.)
Click "Save & Test" to verify the connection
Grafana for beginners: Quick tips to add a data source, choose a visualization type, and more provides more detailed steps on adding data sources through the UI.

Alternatively, you can pre-install data source plugins when running the Docker container:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana \
  -e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-clock-panel,grafana-simple-json-datasource" \
  grafana/grafana-enterprise
This example installs the clock panel and simple JSON datasource plugins Run Grafana Docker image.

For more advanced setups, you can use Docker Compose to define and run Grafana along with other services. The Run Grafana via Docker Compose section provides an example of how to set this up.

Remember to configure your data sources appropriately based on your specific requirements and the types of data you want to visualize in Grafana.
