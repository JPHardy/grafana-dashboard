It looks like you're trying to access a file named `grafana_dashboard_config.json`, but the system is indicating that it's a directory instead of a file. This can happen if the directory and the file have the same name, or if there's a misconfiguration in your deployment.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Directory vs. File**: Ensure that `grafana_dashboard_config.json` is indeed a file and not a directory. You can use the `ls -l` command to list the contents of the `/opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards` directory and check the file type.

2. **ConfigMap Configuration**: Verify that your ConfigMap is correctly set up. It should map the `grafana_dashboard_config.json` key to the correct file path. Here's the relevant part of your deployment file:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - name: grafana-dashboard-config
       configMap:
         name: grafana-dashboard-config
         items:
           - key: grafana_dashboard_config.json
             path: grafana_dashboard_config.json
   ```

3. **Volume Mounts**: Ensure that the volume mounts are correctly configured to mount the ConfigMap to the desired path:
   ```yaml
   volumeMounts:
     - name: grafana-dashboard-config
       mountPath: /opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards
       readOnly: true
   ```

4. **Permissions**: Check the permissions of the directory and the file to ensure that the user has the necessary read permissions.
