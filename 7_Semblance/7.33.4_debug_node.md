# Debugging Node in Minikube

To debug a node in Minikube, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Start Minikube

First, ensure that Minikube is running. If it is not already running, start it with the following command:

```sh
minikube start
```

## Step 2: SSH into Minikube

To access the Minikube node, use the SSH command:

```sh
minikube ssh
```

## Step 3: Use journalctl to View Logs

Once you are logged into the Minikube node, you can use `journalctl` to view the system logs. For example, to view all logs, use:

```sh
sudo journalctl
```

To view logs for a specific service, such as `kubelet`, use:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u kubelet
```

To follow the logs in real-time, use the `-f` option:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u kubelet -f
```

## Step 4: Exit Minikube SSH

When you are done, exit the SSH session by typing:

```sh
exit
```

## Additional Commands

- To stop Minikube:

    ```sh
    minikube stop
    ```

- To delete the Minikube cluster:

    ```sh
    minikube delete
    ```
