Thanks for sharing the logs. It looks like Grafana is starting up correctly, but there are a few errors related to plugins and a warning about missing directories. However, these shouldn't prevent dashboards from being loaded.

Let's focus on the dashboard provisioning:

1. **Provisioning Logs**: The logs indicate that the dashboard provisioning process started and finished without errors:
   ```
   logger=provisioning.dashboard t=2025-01-09T11:35:29.535489342Z level=info msg="starting to provision dashboards"
   logger=provisioning.dashboard t=2025-01-09T11:35:29.53569184Z level=info msg="finished to provision dashboards"
   ```

2. **Verify Dashboard Path**: Ensure that the ConfigMap is mounted to the correct path in the Grafana pod. The path should be `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards` as specified in your YAML configuration.

3. **Check Mounted Files**: Verify that the dashboard JSON file is present in the mounted directory inside the Grafana pod. You can do this by executing a shell in the Grafana pod:
   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it -n grafana-monitoring <grafana-pod-name> -- ls /var/lib/grafana/dashboards

   kubectl exec -it -n grafana-monitoring grafana-6b7b4d564b-pslwj -- ls /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
   ```

4. **Grafana Configuration**: Ensure that Grafana is configured to load dashboards from the specified directory. This can be done by checking the Grafana configuration file or environment variables.

5. **Reload Dashboards**: Sometimes, manually reloading the dashboards in Grafana can help. You can do this through the Grafana UI or by using the Grafana API.

If the dashboard JSON file is present in the correct directory and Grafana is still not loading it, you might want to check the Grafana provisioning configuration. Ensure that the provisioning configuration file is correctly set up to load dashboards from the specified directory.

To mount the `ConfigMap` containing your Grafana dashboard configuration, you need to ensure that the `ConfigMap` is correctly referenced in your Grafana deployment. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Create the ConfigMap**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: grafana-dashboard-config
     labels:
       grafana_dashboard: "1"
   data:
     sample-dashboard.json: |
       {
         "dashboard": {
           "id": null,
           "uid": null,
           "title": "Sample Dashboard",
           "tags": [],
           "timezone": "browser",
           "schemaVersion": 16,
           "version": 0,
           "refresh": "5s",
           "panels": [
             {
               "type": "graph",
               "title": "Sample Graph",
               "gridPos": {
                 "x": 0,
                 "y": 0,
                 "w": 24,
                 "h": 9
               },
               "id": 1,
               "datasource": null,
               "targets": [
                 {
                   "target": "sample.metric",
                   "refId": "A"
                 }
               ],
               "lines": true,
               "linewidth": 1,
               "nullPointMode": "null"
             }
           ]
         },
         "overwrite": false
       }
   EOF
   ```

2. **Update the Grafana Deployment**:
   Ensure that the `ConfigMap` is mounted to the correct path in your Grafana deployment. Here’s an example of how to update your deployment YAML:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: grafana
     namespace: grafana-monitoring
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: grafana
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: grafana
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: grafana
             image: grafana/grafana:latest
             volumeMounts:
               - name: grafana-dashboard-config
                 mountPath: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
                 readOnly: true
         volumes:
           - name: grafana-dashboard-config
             configMap:
               name: grafana-dashboard-config
   ```

3. **Apply the Updated Deployment**:
   Apply the updated deployment configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f <your-deployment-file>.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify the Mount**:
   Check if the `ConfigMap` is correctly mounted in the Grafana pod:
   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it -n grafana-monitoring <grafana-pod-name> -- ls /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
   ```

By following these steps, your Grafana instance should be able to load the dashboard configuration from the `ConfigMap`. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!
